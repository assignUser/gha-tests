name: Filter Priority

# The docs for the interplay of the `tags`, `branches` and `paths` filters is bit unclear
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushbranchestagsbranches-ignoretags-ignore
# With the below test cases it becomes clear that the workflow runs if this is true: tags || (branches && paths)
# If `branches` or `tags` are not defined they are true.

# Test Scenario 1: !tags && branch && paths = true
# on:
#   push:
#     tags:
#       - filter-priority
#     branches:
#       - filter-priority
#     paths:
#       - ".github/workflows/filter_priority.yml"

# Test Scenario 2: (!)tags && branch && !paths = ?
# on commit: !tags && branch && !paths = false
# on tag: tags && branch && !paths = true
# on:
#   push:
#     tags:
#       - filter-priority
#     branches:
#       - filter-priority
#     paths:
#       - "README.md"

# Test Scenario 3: !tags && !branch && paths = false
# on:
#   push:
#     tags:
#       - filter-priority
#     branches:
#       - nothing
#     paths:
#       - ".github/workflows/filter_priority.yml"

# Test Scenario 4: (!)tags && branch = ?
# on commit: !tags && branch = true
# on tag: tags && branch = true
# on:
#   push:
#     tags:
#       - filter-priority
#     branches:
#       - filter-priority

# Test Scenario 5: (!)tags && !branch = ?
# on commit: !tags && !branch = false
# on tag: tags && !branch = true
