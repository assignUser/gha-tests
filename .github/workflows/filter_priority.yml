name: Filter Priority

# The behavior of the `tag` and `branch` filters is clearly described in the docs:
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushbranchestagsbranches-ignoretags-ignore
# But it is unclear how `paths` plays into it, is it: `paths || (tags && branches)` or `paths && tags && branches` if all are defined?

# Test Scenario 1: !tags && branch && paths = true
# on:
#   push:
#     tags:
#       - filter-priority
#     branches:
#       - filter-priority
#     paths:
#       - ".github/workflows/filter_priority.yml"

# Test Scenario 2: (!)tags && branch && !paths = ?
# on commit: !tags && branch && !paths = false
# on tag: tags && branch && !paths = true
# on:
#   push:
#     tags:
#       - filter-priority
#     branches:
#       - filter-priority
#     paths:
#       - "README.md"

# Test Scenario 3: !tags && !branch && paths = false
# on:
#   push:
#     tags:
#       - filter-priority
#     branches:
#       - nothing
#     paths:
#       - ".github/workflows/filter_priority.yml"

# Test Scenario 4: (!)tags && branch = ?
# on commit: !tags && branch = true
# on tag: tags && branch = true
# This should not run on commit according to the docs but does?
# > If you define both branches/branches-ignore and paths/paths-ignore,
# > the workflow will only run when both filters are satisfied.
